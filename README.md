- If you have extra time or want to practice your new Formik skills, here are some ideas for improvements that you could make to the signup form which are listed in order of increasing difficulty:
  - Disable the submit button while the user has attempted to submit (hint: formik.isSubmitting)
  - Add a reset button with formik.handleReset or <button type="reset">.
  - Pre-populate initialValues based on URL query string or props passed to <SignupForm>.
  - Change the input border color to red when a field has an error and isn’t focused
  - Add a shake animation to each field when it displays an error and has been visited
  - Persist form state to the browser’s sessionStorage so that form progress is kept in between page refreshes
